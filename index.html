  <h2>The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</h2>
  <p>This is assignment 4.3 of the Full-Stack Web Bootcamp on Udemy</p>
  <p>I have just included the portfolio that came with the assignment</p>
  <p>I am taking this course to learn HTML and CSS, and maybe some Javascript.</p>
  <p>All HTML code is written by hand. I do not use autocomplete at all. I also don't use an IDE, I use Notepad++.</p>
  <p>I believe that this is important as a beginner. To not take shortcuts.</p>
